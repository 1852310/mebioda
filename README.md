Course repository for Methods in Biodiversity Analysis
------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains materials for the MSc course _Methods in Biodiversity Analysis_, offered through a 
collaboration between [Naturalis](http://naturalis.nl), [IBL](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/biology),
and [CML](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/wiskunde-en-natuurwetenschappen/milieuwetenschappen). The course will
take place in weeks 48 through 51 (of 2017, and presumably onwards), mainly in the Sylvius Building with some 
practicals in the Van Steenis Building, both on the main (bio)science campus of Leiden.

The goal of the course is to impart data science skills as relevant to biodiversity research. Technical topics to be 
covered will include research reproducibility (e.g. scripting) and data management (e.g. versioning), while the 
scientific applications will encompass biodiversity assessment using DNA sequence data (e.g. metabarcoding),
geospatial data (e.g. ecological niche modeling) and phenotype/morphology data (e.g. morphometrics).
