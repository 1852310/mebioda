Phylogenetic Niche/Trait  Conservatism
=============================================

What’s a niche?
----------------
- Grinellian niche: “The niche‐relationships of  the California thrasher” The Auk 1917.
     - Deﬁned based on observed habitat characteristics  within species distribution (coarse scale).
- Eltonian niche: Animal Ecology 1927
     - Emphasizing local‐scale biotic interactions.
- Reviewed by Soberon (2007)

What’s a niche?
----------------
- Hutchinsonian niche (1957): The set of biotic and abiotic conditions within which a species can persist.  Fundamental vs. realized niche.
    – Where intrinsic growth rate (r0 = per‐capita birth  rate minus death rate) ≥ 0.
- Reviewed and applied to current  understanding by Holt (2009).

Wiens et al., 2010
----------------
- Sometimes niche‐related traits evolve rapidly,  sometimes very slowly
“Niche conservatism (NC) is the retention of  niche‐related ecological traits over time.”
     – Note interchangeable use of ‘niche’ and ‘trait’.
- Phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) =  retention of traits within clades (among  related species)

- Contrasting ﬁne vs. coarse‐scale niches
   - What are some examples at each scale?
   - What gives rise to the barriers (depicted in the  inset) in each example?

Wiens et al., 2010
----------------
- “A test of NC without a related question or application is somewhat meaningless.”
- NC is scale‐dependent

Community Assembly

Community assembly (Swenson et al.,  2006)

Community assembly (Swenson et al.,  2006)
----------------
- Show spatial and phylogenetic scale  dependency.

Wiens et al., 2010
----------------
- Species distribution models (SDM)
     - Mapping the climatic distribution of a species  provides a predictor for climatic factors that set  range limits.
     - NC can be tested by asking whether the SDM for  one species predicts the geographic range of its  sister species (Peterson et al., 1999).
     
Wiens et al., 2010    

- Species distribution models (SDM)
     - Is that good enough? Does the current realized niche  of a species tend to reﬂect its fundamental niche?
     - Take care with ‘forbidden combinations!’
     - Jared Diamond (1975) catalogued all bird species occurring  on each of many small islands, all nearby to each other.
     - Dubbed all combinations of species that never occurred  together as “forbidden combinations”.
     - Received much ﬂack and sparked much debate over  dynamics of realized vs. fundamental niches.
     
Wiens et al., 2010
----------------
- Climatic change
    - Paleontology suggests the climate change induced  movement of species more than changes in traits  or extinction (p. 1314).
    - Review of 53 bird species showed 48 tracked their  previous climatic niches as climate changed (p.  1316; Tingley et al., 2009).

Wiens et al., 2010
----------------
- Invasive species
    - Wiens and Graham (2005) found a strong  relationship between native and introduced range  limits.
- Species interactions
    - Figs and ﬁg wasps
    - Fungus‐farming ants and their fungi (Chapela et  al., 1994)
    - Herbivores and plants (Wieblen et al., 2006)

Wieblen et al., 2006
----------------
- Assessed host‐plant phylogenetic  conservatism of insect‐herbivores in
- Found that 25‐44% of herbivores feeding on  more than one plant species were clustered  on the plant phylogenetic tree; 0‐6% were  overdispersed.

Phylogenetic and functional diversity  and ecosystem (aggregate) function
----------------
- Cadoje et al., 2009: Phylogenetic diversity explains grassland productivity better than traits.
- So where do traits come into the picture?
- Why is PNC typically about the environment or phylogeny and not the traits?

Proportion NC:not NC
----------------
- Using realized niches as a baseline, how can  we assess what proportion of species or  clades show NC in response to climate change  or invasions?
      – Extinction and non‐invasion typically make no data  points!
      
Hof et al., 2010
----------------
- Phylogenetic signals in the climatic niches of  the world’s amphibians.
- First analysis for PNC in entire clade  worldwide.

Hof et al., 2010 ‐ methods
----------------
- Ordination technique
    - Climatic niche estimated based on species  locations
    - Deﬁnes the mean and variance (breadth) of  environmental conditions used by the species
    - What you see is what you get: No population  dynamics or ecophysiological estimates involved

Hof et al., 2010 ‐ methods
----------------
- Blomberg’s randomization
   - Take phylogenetic tree and randomly distribute  data (traits, etc.) across tips.
   - Ask whether that data ﬁts the phylogeny better than when randomly distributed
- Vicariance component analysis (VCA)
   - How much of species‐level niche variance is  explained at diﬀerent taxonomic levels.

Hof et al., 2010 ‐ methods
----------------
- ANOSIM
     - Niche dissimilarity calculated as Euclidean distance (in  ordination space) between sp pairs.
     - Then ask: Is average dissimilarity between species  within a group (e.g., genus) less than dissimilarity  between species of diﬀerent groups?
     - Yes = PNC!
- Wilcoxon rank sums
     - Calculated pairwise niche overlap (on OMI axes 1 and  2)
     - Asked: is niche overlap higher within groups than  between them?
     - Yes = PNC!

Hof et al., 2010 ‐ results
----------------
- PNC observed in majority of cases using all  analyses.
- However, phylogenetic signal was variable  among diﬀerent regions within each clade.
     – E.g., using ANOSIM, 3 of 13 analyses showed  larger within‐family niche diﬀerences than  between family niche diﬀerences.
     
Hof et al., 2010 ‐ Discussion
----------------
- Their analyses were based on realized climatic  niches
    – How would you expect the results to diﬀer if  based on fundamental niches?
- Can their results be used to infer amphibian  clade responses to climate change?

Ackerly 2009
----------------
- Introducing the ‘felsen;
- 1 felsen = 1 unit of variance between sister  taxa in ln‐tranformed traits per million years.
- Measured rate of accrual of variance in trait  values within clades for:
    - Traits: mature height, seed size, leaf size
    - Clades: Aesculus, Acer (north temperate);  Caenothus, Arbutoideae, (California); lobeliads  and silverswords (Hawaii)

Ackerly 2009
----------------
- Accrual of variance in height through time.
- 0.14 (Acer) to 0.79 felsens (silversword)
- Average rates: seed size < height < leaf size

Questions for John Wiens
----------------
- Where are the traits in PNC?
- Why does phylogenetic diversity explain  ecosystem function better than  functional  diversity?
- Is climatic niche modeling enough to predict  species/clade responses?
- How can we improve our ability to predict  those responses?

Discussion with John Weins
----------------
- Previous suggestions that narrower niche  width is correlated with niche diversiﬁcation
    - He tried to ﬁnd this in newts but didn’t, it seemed  the other way around.
- Where is niche conservatism now?
    - Some still think “it’s stupid” ‐> answer is whether  you ﬁnd it a useful way of thinking or not.
    
Discussion with John Wiens
----------------
- What’s the way forward with PNC?
    - Mechanisms behind it are largely unknown.
- So is it dangerous to use it if we don’t understand  why it works (e.g., to predict species/clade/  ecosystem responses)?
    - PNC helps to see pajerns. We can use those pajerns  to generate hypotheses, and test those at the species  scale.	We can then use that more mechanistic  knowledge to inform further investigation at the  phylogenetic scale.
- (Ty) The feedback of research between scales is  important and a way forward for PNC and  species/ecosystem predictions.
