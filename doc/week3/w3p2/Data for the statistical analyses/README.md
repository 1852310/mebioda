**Two-way Anova and the Dunnett tests.**

1. For tree balance at `CSR`, the `post CSR inverval times` and `end simulation times`, we analyze the treatments involving a combination of extintion types and intensity with `two-way ANOVA` and `Tukey-corrected multiple comparison testing`, in order to see if there are any significant treatment-by-intensity interactions.

2. Dunnett's test for comparison against a standard--CTRL vs. all other treatments.
