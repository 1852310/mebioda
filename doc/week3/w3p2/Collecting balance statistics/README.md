Collecting balance statistics
-----------------------------

These R files cointain the scripts that were used to manipulate the NEXUS files produced by MESA. The output files provided on dryad are called e.g MESA_X5Balance_test_s4885_noext0.9_NEW.out. The other outputfiles with other headings were not given. To produce all the outputs (the one provided and the one not provided) we need the NEXUS files. In dryad it is possible only to download the scripts to generate those files.
