Collecting tree balance and root ages at key times
-------------------------------------------------

The Colless index of imbalance values for each treatment-intensity were collected at CSR relative times (CSR time, CSR end-mid 1quartile, CSR end-mid, CSR end-mid 3quartile) and at pre extintion time (300), post extintion event (305), at the CRS end-mid time (470) and at the end of simulation (600). 

The values collected were later rearranged manually in EXCEL and exported these files in txt to be used for the statistical analyses. 
At the same key times the root ages were collected as well.
