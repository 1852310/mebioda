Wouldn't it be nice if we could detect _diversification rate shifts_ (so, changes in the net difference
between speciation, `λ`, and extinction, `μ`) in relation to state shifts? This would be our ticket to
detecting _adaptive ratiations_ and _key innovations_.

What are some of the options?

- The **Bi**nary-**S**tate **S**peciation and **E**xtinction model (**BiSSE**)
- Six parameters: 
  - The instantaneous rates of speciation `λ` and extinction `μ` when the lineage is in state `0` (e.g., _herbivory_)
  - The rates (`λ`, `μ`) when the lineage is in state `1` (e.g., _carnivory_)
  - The instantaneous rates of character state change (0 ⟶ 1 and 1 ⟶ 0)
