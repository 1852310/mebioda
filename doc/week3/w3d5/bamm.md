Wouldn't it be nice if we could detect _diversification rate shifts_ (so, changes in the net difference
between speciation, `λ`, and extinction, `μ`) in relation to state shifts? This would be our ticket to
detecting _adaptive ratiations_ and _key innovations_.

What are some of the options?

- The **Bi**nary-**S**tate **S**peciation and **E**xtinction model (**BiSSE**)
- Assumes that: 
  - An accurate rooted phylogenetic tree with branch lengths is known (the “inferred tree”) 
  - The character state is known for each of the terminal taxa
  - The tree is assumed complete: all extant species in the group have been found and included 
  - The tree is ultrametric (i.e., the total root-to-tip distance is the same for all tips)
- Estimates six parameters: 
  - The instantaneous rates of speciation `λ<sub>0</sub>` and extinction `μ<sub>0</sub>`, 
    when the lineage is in state `0` (e.g., _herbivory_)
  - The rates (`λ<sub>1</sub>`, `μ<sub>1</sub>`) when the lineage is in state `1` (e.g., _carnivory_)
  - The instantaneous rates of character state change (`0 ⟶ 1`, _q<sub>01</sub>_ and `1 ⟶ 0`, _q<sub>10</sub>_)
