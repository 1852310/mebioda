Colless' imbalance
------------------

Add up, for all (_n_-1) nodes in a tree with _n_ tips, the absolute difference between
the tips subtended by the child "on the left" and that of the child on the right
(i.e. | _T_<sub>R</sub> - _T_<sub>L</sub> |). Then, normalize this value by dividing
through the maximum value for a tree that size, which is ((_n_-1)*(_n_-2))/2

This value can be computed in R using `ape` and `apTreeShape` thusly:

```R
library(ape)
library(apTreeshape)
tree <- read.tree(text="((A,B),C);")
aptree <- as.treeshape(tree)
ic <- colless(aptree)
```

I2 imbalance
------------
**Mooers AO & Heard SB**, 1997. Inferring evolutionary process from phylogenetic tree 
shape. _Quarterly Review of Biology_ 72: 31â€“54.

A perhaps reasonable critique of the _I_<sub>C</sub> index is that it weights "deep"
nodes heavier (consider how the diff between left and right may be much higher for deep
nodes than for shallow ones). An alternative index might therefore, as in this case,
normalize each node right away using _j_ = the number of tips subtended by the focal 
node.

Which one might compute, for example, thusly:

```perl
use Bio::Phylo::IO 'parse_tree';
$ic = parse_tree(
	'-format' => 'newick',
	'-string' => '((A,B),C);',
)->calc_i2;
```
