# Instructions for the SDM report

## A short report on the selected species 

Expected:
-	Well-structured report with clear sections
-	Proper use of citations â€“ (E.g. try Mendeley if you use MS word)
-	Use visual examples to justify your decisions! 
-	Use outcome of MaxEnt
-	Use of ArcGIS when necessary to create better maps than MAXENT

## Introduction
-	What species have you selected? 
-	What are the main known biological characteristics of the species?
-	Why is this species significant? What makes it special?
-	How are SDM going to help you investigate this species?
-	What is your research question and hypothesis? 
-	In this section, focus on the ecological and biological aspects of your report

##	Methodology & Results
-	Provide an overview, in the form a flowchart perhaps, of the steps you will perform in 
  this section to test your research hypothesis
-	Occurrence data
  - What are the characteristics of your occurrence data? 
  - Are there any spatial biases?
  - Does it properly reflect the species ecological niche?
  - What corrections did you apply to your data?
- Environmental data
  - Which were the final variables you selected and why?
  - What were the results of your autocorrelation and multicollinearity tests?
- Model settings
  - Which model settings you used and why?
- Model output
  - Performance:
    - Summarize the performance of the model utilizing the diagnostics of MAXENT
    - What was your AUC?
    - What do the Response Curves tell about your model?
    - Can you identify regions where your model predictions should not be trusted?
- SDM Projections
  - Interpret the results of the following scenarios:
    - Present World data (if you trained your model in a specific AOI)
    - Any future scenario you selected:
  - Did the geographical space available for the species increased or decreased?
  - Do you reckon the species can reach new locations on its own (if the new space exists)?

##	Discussion & conclusion
- Do a short discussion of your results and finalize with a summary addressing if your results 
  are according to your expectations (research questions) and provide some on how to potentially 
  improve your model or if further research is needed
- Be critical of your results, interpret them in terms of biology and ecology, but also on the 
  limitations of SDM.
