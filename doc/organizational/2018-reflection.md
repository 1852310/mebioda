Reflection on the student evaluations for MeBioDA 2018
======================================================

Overall
-------

The course is evaluated very positively overall: the students grade 
it 7.7/10, and all of the 4 lecturers are graded between 7.1 and 8.4
(out of 10).

On individual aspects of the course, the students also assign high
ratings. The scores for individual aspects are out of 5, and are
in the range of 3.4-4.8 (n=28). The lowest of these scores (3.4) was
given for the question as to whether one of the guest lecturers was
'inspiring', which is subjective and hard to address at a course
coordination level. Above that, the next lowest scores are for the
course structure (3.6) and how the teaching methods accomplish the
learning goals (3.6). These last two are explored on the basis of
explicitly voiced feedback.

Explicit, actionable feedback
-----------------------------

At the end of the course, we held a one-hour plenary session to 
collect feedback on the course as a whole. Other explicit feedback
was obtained from the forms that were collected during the exam.
The feedback was positive in general, but some points of criticism
will be included in the next iteration of the course:

- **practicals** - the feedback on the practicals is a mixed bag.
  The students state that they wish to do more exercises and that
  they want more freedom to do this independently: this year we did
  relatively many of them in plenary form on the screen. We did 
  this in response to feedback from last year where one of the 
  criticisms was that the students were made to struggle too much
  on their own. In other words, we are still working in trying to 
  strike the right balance between practicing independently and 
  following canned examples. This process is hampered by the fact
  that there is **not enough assistance**. The course needs a 
  competent student assistant with a solid grounding in computational
  biology. These are hard to find anyhow, and funding for this
  assistant is seemingly not available. None of the institutions
  that enjoy the existence of this course (i.e. IBL, CML and 
  Naturalis) are willing to pay for assistance. Hence, it has been
  advanced by the research group Endless Forms, which will be 
  unable to do this again (!). **The course needs a paid teaching
  assistant.**
- **course structure** - the course is mostly taught from a 
  repository (naturalis.github.io/mebioda) that includes slides,
  class schedules, data files, example scripts, etc. The best way
  to interact with this repository eludes the students at first,
  so to struggle with finding what they need. In the next iteration
  we will instruct them earlier and more exhaustively on this.
