Species delimitation with DNA barcodes
======================================

Species concepts and delimitation intro
---------------------------------------

The following slide show provides an overview of species concepts and the application
of species delimitation techniques to natural history collection specimens:

BIN divergence thresholds
-------------------------

![](BIN_divergence.png)

Correspondence between species present in eight datasets and OTUs recognized 
through single linkage clustering with sequence divergence thresholds ranging from 
0.1â€“6.0%. 

- **Green** indicates the number of OTUs whose members perfectly match species
- **Yellow** shows those that merge members of two or more species
- **Orange** indicates cases where a species was split into two or more OTUs
- **Red** represents a mixture of splits and merges
