Shell script file using vsearch and another using usearch. With vsearch all the scripts run and in the end I get an OTU table. With usearch(I think what JÃ²zsef prefers to use) I get an error for which I could not find anything online so I wrote to Robert Edgar. They are not the definitive files (sure they can be implemented) but I thought it was better to have them here.
