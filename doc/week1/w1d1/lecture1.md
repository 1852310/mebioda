Introduction to the course
==========================

Who are we? Who am I?
---------------------

Learning goals
--------------
- To develop a data-centric view of biodiversity research
- To adopt principles and practices of open science
- To learn computational skills in biodiversity analysis
- To improve our communication abilities

Prerequisites and assumptions
-----------------------------
- We are biologists: we are aware of the principles and 
  practices of molecular biology, biogeography, systematics,
  and evolution
- We are natural scientists: we've had previous training
  in statistics and maths, know how to read scientific
  publications, and know how to present research, orally 
  and in writing
- We are not computer scientists, but we're not afraid of
  computers
