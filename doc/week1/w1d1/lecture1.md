Introduction to the course
==========================

Who are we? Who am I?
---------------------
- Different academic backgrounds (IBL, CML)
- Different interests, needs, and expectations
- Different skill levels and experiences

Prerequisites and assumptions
-----------------------------
- We are biologists: we are aware of the principles and 
  practices of molecular biology, biogeography, systematics,
  and evolution
- We are natural scientists: we've had previous training
  in statistics (e.g. what is a PCA? What is Bayesian 
  statistics?), know how to read scientific publications, 
  and know how to present research, orally and in writing
- We are not computer scientists, but we're not afraid of
  computers
- We are going to learn together: questions, responses,
  discussions, interruptions, are always welcome

Learning goals
--------------
- To develop a data-centric view of biodiversity research
- To adopt principles and practices of open science
- To learn computational skills in biodiversity analysis
- To improve our communication abilities
