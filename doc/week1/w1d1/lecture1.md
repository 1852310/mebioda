Methods in Biodiversity Analysis
================================

Introductions
-------------

- Different academic backgrounds (IBL, CML, ...)
- Different interests, needs, and expectations
- Different skill levels and experiences

> Please introduce each other, mentioning at least the following:
> - Name
> - Which faculty (IBL, CML, ...) 
> - Which master's programme
> - Any concurrent activities (internships, courses, etc.)
> - Data analytical skills (e.g. programming, statistics, bioinformatics)
> - Your expectations and needs

Prerequisites and assumptions
-----------------------------

- We are biologists: we are aware of the principles and practices of molecular biology, 
  ecology, biogeography, systematics, and evolution
- We've had previous training in statistics (e.g. what is a 
  PCA? What are residuals? What is R<sup>2</sup>? What is Bayesian statistics?)
- We know how to read scientific publications, and know how to present research, orally 
  and in writing
- We are not computer scientists, but we're not afraid of computers
- We are going to learn together: questions, responses, discussions, interruptions, are 
  always welcome

Learning goals
--------------

- To develop a data-centric view of biodiversity research
- To adopt principles and practices of open science
- To learn computational skills in biodiversity analysis
- To improve our communication and teamwork abilities

  analysis; Niche modeling

### [Week 3: Comparative Analysis](../../week3)
- **Lecture topics**: Trait diversity; Tree topologies; Comparative character analysis; 
  Diversification
- **Practicals**: Data carpentry, RMarkdown, Phylogenies in R (tree shape, 
  diversification), Likelihood and Bayesian ancestor reconstruction, trait analysis

### [Week 4: Wrap-up and Exam](../../week4)
- **Lecture topics**: Diversity in space, time, and function
- **Exam**

Red thread / model organisms
----------------------------

Some exercises across the weeks will deal with the same model organisms, for which we
all pick our own staple food crop:

- Barcode data collection
- Paper about barcode diversity
- Occurrence data collection and ENM
- Functional trait data collection

Links to other courses
----------------------

**Methods in Biodiversity Analysis as well as the following courses are compulsory in the 
master Biodiversity and Sustainability, 2017-2018:**

- [Genomic Architecture](https://studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/courses/show/67715/genomic-architecture) -
  We will give more attention to the data science and bioinformatics side of genome 
  (and other) sequencing. Bioinformatics in relation to HTS will be more Unix-based. 
- [Advanced Statistics](https://studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/courses/show/67699/Advanced-Statistics) - 
  We will refresh our R skills but apply them more specifically to cases involving 
  biodiversity.

In addition, Methods in Biodiversity Analysis is an **elective** in:

- Biology: Biology and Education, 2017-2018
- Biology: Biology and Science-Based Business, 2017-2018
- Biology: Biology and Science Communication & Society, 2017-2018
- Biology: General Biology Programme (no research specialisation), 2017-2018

In relation to the **old** programme and the master **Evolutionary Biology**, 2017-2018:

- [(old) Methods In Biodiversity Analysis](https://studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/courses/show/56721/Methods-in-Biodiversity-Analysis) - 
  In previous years, the course named "Methods in Biodiversity Analysis" was much
  less geared towards data science. Although the old and the new course cover (some)
  of the same scientific concepts, the courses are different in practical terms and 
  skills acquired.
- [Integrative Taxonomy](https://studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/courses/show/72333/integrative-taxonomy) - 
  Focuses more on taxonomy and systematics, less on data science and informatics. Is 
  mostly "Old MIBA" under a new name, in the _Evolutionary Biology_ master.

Teaching materials
------------------

- There is no book except for [OSODOS](http://osodos.org)
- Most lectures reference several publications. You should be broadly aware of their
  contents insofar as a biologist can (so skip over the formulas).
- Slides (re-formatted as handouts) are at http://github.com/naturalis/mebioda
- Handouts and slides are subject to ongoing (wiki-like) improvement.
- During the course we will learn how to use this platform to share data, scripts, files 
  with each other.

Teamwork
--------

- With the hands-on parts of the course we will try to learn in pairs, helping each other
- At least one of you **bring a laptop**, also to the lectures
- All assignments are individual, though

Grading
-------

- Exam: 50%
- Paper presentation week 1: 20%
- Report week 2: 20%
- Participation: 10%
