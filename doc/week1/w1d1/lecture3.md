Introduction to molecular biodiversity
======================================

Sequencing techniques
---------------------
- Full genomes
- Barcoding of specific markers
- Metabarcoding
- Probing for ultraconserved regions
- RNA sequencing
- etc.

Sequencing platforms
--------------------
- Old school: Sanger sequencing
- Short read standard: Illumina HiSeq
- Long reads: PacBio
- Longer reads: Nanopore MinION
